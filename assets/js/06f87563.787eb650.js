If you want to set up an Autonomys cluster, you can go to the Wiki and see all the commands and templates I use when creating mine.

However, when that happens it will almost surely be time for a new Article on all the changes, which will have a YouTube video. So it sort of works itself out. To highlight something that I think is really cool - I will do my best to keep the Wiki updated.

And lastly, I want to move a lot of my content over from substack, as well as update some of my older guides. This is a big project as I have been making guides and videos for a year now.
